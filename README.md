# LTA-Traffic-Demo
Data.gov.sg (Project Nimbus) LTA Traffic Demo

# Background
[Project Nimbus](http://projectnimbus.org) is an initiative that hopes to solve innovatorsâ€™ problem of finding data sets and services by offering a central place for authoritative and reliable data and services access from government and commercial entities in Singapore.
This project was built since 2010.
Project Nimbus was acquired by IDA and now it's data.gov.sg.

# LTA Demo
This project was initially a demo using LTA dataset to display traffic images, as well as other traffic conditions, nearby filters and so on.
This demo was to demonstrate Project Nimbus available datasets putting them into one single application.
The logic of this application still stands valid even after the port to data.gov.sg
